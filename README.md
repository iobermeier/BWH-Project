##Our Project
Each year, the US dumps hundreds of millions of tons of municipal solid waste (MSW) in landfills, much of which could be diverted to proper disposal channels. As of 2018, food comprised the largest component of MSW with 24% and plastics acccounted for another 18%. [1](https://www.epa.gov/facts-and-figures-about-materials-waste-and-recycling/national-overview-facts-and-figures-materials#NationalPicture) 

In an effort to divert so much waste to landfills, we encourage US residents to use our platform to answer whether their waste could be disposed through alternative methods. After a user registers to our platform with their zip code, they are able to choose from a series of widgets or input the material they want to dispose of. Based on their input, we access a trained model that tells us whether the material can be recycled or composted following up with recommendations of local drop off centers or online resources.

##Impact
Waste Not, Worry Not eases the concern of its users by ensuring that they are properly disposing of their waste by diverting it from landfills. Depending upon local community resources such as composting centers or recycling hubs creates local jobs for those facilites and grants a return of materials such as compost that can be used in community gardens.
